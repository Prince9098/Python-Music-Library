# üéµ Music Library (Python + MySQL)

A **Music Library REST API** built using **Flask** and **MySQL**, designed for intermediate-level developers to manage artists, albums, tracks, and playlists. This project demonstrates RESTful API design, database operations, and practical SQL usage without relying on an ORM, making it an excellent learning resource and a lightweight backend for music-related applications.

## üìù Overview

This project provides a backend API to manage a music library with the following capabilities:

- Maintain a catalog of **artists**, **albums**, and **tracks**.
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for all entities.
- Build and manage **playlists**, including adding tracks dynamically.
- Search functionality to filter tracks by **title, artist, or album**.
- Paginated endpoints for scalable retrieval of large datasets.
- Uses explicit SQL queries via **mysql-connector-python**, making it easy to understand SQL interactions.
- Optional Docker setup for running MySQL and the Flask app with minimal configuration.
